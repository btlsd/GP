## Web Demo

`index.html` contains a simple Pyodide-based text RPG. Open it in a browser or run a local server (`python -m http.server`) and navigate to the file to play. When the game starts, the output window shows the title "군포 프로젝트". If initialization or gameplay fails, the corresponding error code and message appear in the output.
